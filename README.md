Microservice-boot
==============

This repository contains a ready-to-run Spring Boot application, complete with production grade features like
monitoring, health-checks etc. It intends to be a fork-and-deploy starting point, when developing a new Spring Boot
microservice.

Spare yourself all the fuss of wiring up dependencies, setting up monitoring reporters or configuring basic Spring
context. Instead just fork this repository and get straight to business.
